# Advanced-Classification-Techniques
- I have done EDA on the Titanic Data
- in addition to doing Preprocessing as well.
- I have used Advanced Classfifcation techniques such as
- Decision tree , Random forest and AdaBoost Calssifiers.
- I have also reduced the existing Overfitting by applying many techniques and changing hyperparameters.
- I have got a similar Accuracy of 82% and sometimes 79% with no overfitting
